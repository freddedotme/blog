# Introduction

This project was a part of a course called System Design with a User Perspective. Our task was to create a taxi
application with focus on the user experience. We decided to go with the name Minderwertig since its meaning is the
opposite of Uber which is a major taxi company.

The team consisted of me ([@freddedotme](https://github.com/freddedotme)), Ardalan ([@pkrll](https://github.com/pkrll)),
Ulf ([@ulfsigvardsson](https://github.com/ulfsigvardsson)), Daniel ([@dannebra](https://github.com/dannebra)) and Kevin
([@Keffin](https://github.com/Keffin)).

The project started January 14 and ended March 5.

# My role

During the initial start I decided to do some design sketches for Minderwertig that the team liked, which resulted in me
taking the design role of the project. We aimed for something that was minimalistic and clean, similar to Uber.

Apart from being responsible from the design I also helped with CSS and Javascript (VueJS).

# Tools

During our project we used GitHub as our main tool, it housed our code and kanban projects.
I think our way of working really turned out great and for once I felt like I used git and GitHub the right way.

Some fun stats about the project:

- 69 closed pull requests
- 79 issues (59 closed)
- 332 commits

# Outcome

We finished all our 3 mandatory user groups, the client, the driver and the dispatcher, in time.
The quality of the project was really high until the last few days where we just wanted to be done and move on.

We had a working communication between the user groups using VueJS and websockets and we used Google Maps both for
displaying driving paths and auto-complete for destinations.

Overall I'm really happy with the outcome and even though we had different skills before the project started I think
we had a good group dynamic and delivered something of high quality.
