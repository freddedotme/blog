![GitHub projects overview]({{ "/assets/git-1.jpg" | absolute_url }})

As a current student of becoming a Computer scientist we regularly use some kind
of Kanban system to manage our tasks and planning. Because of the program I'm
studying our projects are usually filled with code.

Up until recently we used [Trello][trello] for our projects but since we rely on
[GitHub][github] to cooperate we were gladly surprised when they released their
project module which has similar features as Trello. Now all of a sudden we had
both our code and planning under the same roof.

We used the issue tracker to create new issue and link them to the specified
Kanban project and with pull requests we could automatically close multiple
issues and they would be moved to the Done column.

# Pros
- One platform for both planning and writing code
- Automatically moving issues when they are closed

# Cons
- No open source format / export
- No offline support
- Slim features / lacking some essential features

For me, using a module such as projects where I can't download the raw format of
its content makes me heavily rely on GitHub services and availability.

# Summary
I will keep using GitHub projects for my coding projects, it's a neat feature
that keep my projects tidy and structured. Not being able to backup my own
version of my projects make me a bit paranoid but I'm looking past it a bit and
trust GitHub and their data security. If you're already using GitHub and is
about to start a new project I recommend to have a look at it.
