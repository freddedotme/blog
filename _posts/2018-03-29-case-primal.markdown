# Introduction

This project was a part of a course called Operating Systems and Process-Oriented Programming. Our task was to create an
application that in some way used concurrency using threads or similar.

We decided to create a simulation of a savanna where all animals would have their own AI and if possible we would try to
simulate a realistic ecosystem where animals, plants and the environment interacted with eachother.

The team consisted of me ([@freddedotme](https://github.com/freddedotme)), Viktor
([@viktor-enzell](https://github.com/viktor-enzell)), JohannesAlmroth
([@JohannesAlmroth](https://github.com/JohannesAlmroth)), Daniel ([@dannebra](https://github.com/dannebra)), Axel
([@huntexD](https://github.com/huntexD)), David ([@daha2574](https://github.com/daha2574)) and
Love ([@LoveNordling](https://github.com/LoveNordling)).

The project started March 29 and ended May 29.

**This project is currently ongoing and will be updated after it's done.**
